Backup scheduler for Disk ARchive (DAR)

## About

This is a scheduler for the [DAR][] archiver.  It creates full backups
(**full**) with two configurable layers of incremental backups
(**diff** and **incr**).

I have used **Lalikan** continuosly since 2010 with only occasional
minor problems (all fixed by now), and I still use it on a daily
basis.  Unfortunately, however, I have never found the time to write a
manual.
